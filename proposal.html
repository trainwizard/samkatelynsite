            Samuel Bolds and Katelyn Irons just got engaged!
            </h2>
            <h3>
            May 10th, 2014 in Cantigny Park, IL.
            </h3>
            <p>
            

It was a typical weekend home for Samuel and I. We had planned a few weeks ago to come back and he had told me that he was planning us a date. We went to the French Market in downtown Wheaton (an outdoors farmers market) and he bought me a red rose. Little did I know this was only the beginning of everything that he had planned. 

We then drove to Cantigny Park to take a walk through the gardens. Everything was beautiful and in bloom as we walked around, as he secretly tried to set up the perfect spot with his friend the photographer. The thought did cross my mind that it would be the perfect place to propose, but I wasnâ€™t expecting it.

The perfect place was found in the middle of a tulip garden, with a single chair in the center. Samuel made me sit in it to take my picture, then all of a sudden he got very quiet. He asked me if he could say something. He then reminded me of some highlights of conversations we had over the years, of the promises he had made to me and wanted to make. Then he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him! I was so flustered, I almost forgot to say YES! But I did.
